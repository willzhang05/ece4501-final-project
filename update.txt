We have made no revisions to our project idea. 
The powerups we are currently working on are:

Circular cross hair
Faster cross hair
Slower cubespeed
Cube magnet

We have thought about adding negative powerups - but we are trying to implement these first and then move onto adding more.

The work hasn't really been split due to everyone's final schedules being different, but everyone is contributing equally.
