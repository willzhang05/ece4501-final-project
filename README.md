Mini Project 4 Solution

To run our solution requires a couple of additional steps. 

First open the project in driverlib/driverlib

Build all targets for this file. 

This should create a .lib file in driverlib/rvmdk/

Open up our project finalproj

On the source folder, right click, Add existings files. 

From the drop down, select .lib files

Navigate to ddriverlib/rvmdk, and click on the lib file

Build target and run :)
